# NRLA jupyter/sage notebooks

A couple of notebook for jupyter using sage kernel, that implement some of the
algorithms from the course "Numerisches Rechnen und Lineare Algebra".

These make it easy to check solutions for homework or during studying.
Intermediate results are also printed, so this makes it easy to locate errors.


### Warning

I have no idea what I'm doing.
